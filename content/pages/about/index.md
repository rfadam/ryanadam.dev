I'm Ryan Adam and I currently work as a Software Engineer for JPMorgan Chase in Glasgow.

Originally I am from and grew up in Kirkcaldy, Scotland (known for being the home of both Adam Smith & Linoleum), before spending 4 years in Edinburgh studying Computer Science at Heriot Watt University.

I graduated with Heriot Watt in 2015 as a BSc Computer Science with 1st Class Honours and moved to Glasgow to take up a role on the Technology Analyst Program with JPMorgan Chase.

I've been there ever since, making Glasgow my home and still trying to adjust to being an adult (have having free time.) After renting for 3 years I finally stepped onto the housing ladder and bought my first flat in the city - so head first into DIY also.

At work I'm mainly working in Full Stack development across the firm, focusing on Java, React and other things in-between - but still working with web technologies, down to data storage and moving things to PaaS from legacy hardware.

At home I'm mostly doing things with Docker, a bit of IOT and trying to get my photos organised. I have plans to run Ethernet everywhere & automate all the things now I can finally hammer a nail into a wall.

Away from technology I'm a Season Pass Holder for Scottish Rugby home internationals at Murrayfield, enjoy making fresh pasta from scratch, baking the odd thing when its Bake Off season and exploring new places (although everyone my age says that).
