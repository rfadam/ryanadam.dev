So since the middle of 2020 and my initial attempts at sourdough bread, I learned quickly that types of flour matter when baking.

As it appears that no country can agree on what to call the same flour, I'm leaving this here and a quick guide for me and anyone else that finds this useful.

Please do not take this as the be all and end all - but more of a quick guide based on me searching and trying to figure things out.

Notes:

* This only really covers white wheat flour
* This is all 'plain flour'. *I.E. there is no raising agents in this.*
* If you unsure about the flour type you have, look at the nutritional information for the protein percentage.
