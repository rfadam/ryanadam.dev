So it has been a running joke between my friends over the years I have led a very sheltered life when it comes to seeing films. 

After realising that I had not seen any of Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings or Matrix films up to that point, my friends in Class of 2011 gave me a crowdsourced list of "Films Ryan Should see" before we all left and went off our different ways to Uni and the like.

Fast forward a good couple of years and when I lived west of the West End before buying my own place, I did go a couple of times to catch the 9PM Saturday Night showing of something at the Odeon at Braehead. It was mostly quiet, I was 7 minutes from where I lived and it felt 'correct'. Saturday Night at the Movies, it has somesort of a 60s Americana to it that somehow screams to me "This is an event".

So - fast forward to 2020, where [everyone spent alot more time at home](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_lockdowns) and after Saturday night TV dried up to a shadown of it former self, I thought "It was time to maybe start working though some of these films I have always been wanting to see". And considering there was _nothing else to watch_ then the bar for chosing what to watch was gone.

So since then, that has been my Saturday Night - usually pick a film, kill the lights, get out the Galaxy Minstrals, Soundbar on and just loose myself in the plot for 2 hours or so. Even after lockdown, I've kept going with it as its something I enjoy. Some films I am glad to have spent the time to watch - others not so much.

When I was at the cinema previously, I would usually put up a couple of tweets to say "Go out or avoid this film at the cinema", or "Its good but wait until you can see it for little cost" if I felt the film justified it (either way). No massive film review - more of letting people know if they should drop the cash for cinema ticket or now.

Anyway - if anyone familar with my Twitter feed will know, I kept this up also through Lockdown. Thumbs up were given to Plup Fiction and Spotlight, thumbs down to others.

Which comes to why I wrote this - if any of this seems remotly intresting to you then you see everything I've written (and I can find) on [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/rfadam/). Giving a rating is the exception than the norm, but you can get the idea.
