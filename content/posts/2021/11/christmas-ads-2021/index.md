Its November folks - and you know what that means. Yep - the red cups are back at Starbucks, all shops are playing the [same songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5u9JSnAAU4) and every single brand are bringing out their Christmas Ads.

Ever since John Lewis came out with [their Christmas ads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lewis_%26_Partners_Christmas_advert) starting in the late 2000's, it has become a staple of the run up to Christmas. So much so there is even a [website](https://www.christmasuk.org) that tracks some of them.

Also - this is somehow partly inspired by Cabel Sassers (formally) [Annual look at Fireworks on sale in the Portland, Oregon area.](https://cabel.com/2016/07/04/4th-of-july-fireworks-photos-2016/), plus commentary as I cannot help myself.

So after 2020 was such a weird year - what have the retailers brought to the small screen this year?

Now this is clever.
The fact they have people skating though Christmas is a metaphor that most people will align with - and their ad is, well, skating though Christmas.
It was not over the top but I feel having the scenes almost look like they were on a turntable works beautifully.

Its real, genuine and not over the top.
Some would argue there is no story (and there isn't) - but it doesn't need one.

I like it.

# Argos

</center>

I think Argos took the idea that "Last Christmas was a washout, this year we have lost ground to make up" and just went with it.
It is intense, it seems to hit every possible stereotype of "Christmas++"

Do I blame them? No, not a bit. Alot of people will look at this ad and go "Yep".

Plus I love the bit about the going through the Argos Book (do you even get Argos Books now?). Now thats what I remember from Christmas as a child.

# Boots
<center>

https://youtube.com/watch?v=R-CM_yPJDD0
</center>

My god - Ladies and Gentlemen, Boots has blown this out the park. It's 3 minutes long, it almost brought me to tears, it features products that Boots sells (without reminding me they sell them) and I think we every possible generation in it.

Honestly - this is a return to the heyday of the Epic Christmas Ads that John Lewis started and alot of others played along with. I really hope this gets a full ad break to itself to be shown in full (my guess, Gogglebox on Friday 5th).

Well done Boots. Well done.

Beautiful animation and for the most part simple. Plus the hood on the female IS SOO FLUFFY.

# Currys
<center>

https://youtube.com/watch?v=rnzSN5LqrRs
</center>

Currys just rebranded and this is really in line with their current ads.
Its sweet, but its still along the lines of "We sell this" so it serves their purpose.

Also, I've seen the TV as a Window done before 4 years ago:

(Note - I used to work for Currys until 2015)

# Disney
<center>

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k620f8tV5PI
</center>

I am torn on this. On one hand its a beautiful story and piece of animation.

On the other - Its just washes over me like an American ad (even though its for the UK), full of good meaning but no core.
And that is terrible to write, because its a good ad but it doesn't do it for me for some reason.

Its fine, but not memorable.

# Disneyland Paris
<center>

https://youtube.com/watch?v=a1dGtCu7MuY
</center>

Its an ad I will not get sick of appearing on my TV every day until the end of the year, but also one thats like "sure fine".
Maybe the idea of Christmas at DisneyLand does not appeal to me that much.
Its a muted effort, but still works. Plus you can see the Mum organised it - so these things are true to life.

# Etsy
<center>

https://youtube.com/watch?v=dJAjsGmW4qI
</center>

Lots of Small ads this year, and if they all go along like this I think the shotgun approach should for most usecases.

# Fortnum & Mason
<center>

https://youtube.com/watch?v=_UNdtjpwFPc
</center>

I will never see this ad on TV (as it will be London area only) - but this is just beautiful.
I am unsure if this is actually connected to 'The Nutcracker' directly - but I just don't care.

Even if the Hampers can [cost the price of a Small car.](https://www.fortnumandmason.com/seasonal-events/christmas/hampers)

# GAP
<center>

https://youtube.com/watch?v=4zQZSFxl6Qs
</center>

So I will admit - I did not recognise it was Katy Perry first time I watched it until the studio segments.
Although - if you removed the snow, you could play this ad during the Superbowl.

# Giorgio Armani
<center>

https://youtube.com/watch?v=weppHWs_gjU
</center>

So once again - the rule of "if you don't understand the ad, its for fragrance" holds true.
Plus, I have a feeling that song was used by Harvey Nicols or someone similar in previous years.

# John Lewis
<center>

https://youtube.com/watch?v=ZTttgc0DPA4

</center>

I feel over the past couple of years the John Lewis ad has not been phoning it in - but been on this plinth that everyone holds in high regard.
I still remember "The Journey" (2012), "The Long Wait" (2011) and "The Bear and the Hare" (2013) (that is the first 3 off the top of my head) and being wowed by them, either due to the song or the story or the animation or all 3.

This years (called "An Unexpected Guest") is one of the better ones and has gotten back to the 'core' I feel - but I feel is just a tad late.
Its been done before.

Although - after watching it a couple of times, and [the song](https://lolayoung.lnk.to/TogetherInElectricDreams) becoming an Ear Worm I have started to mellow.
It has the feeling of the previously mentioned ads, that feeling of warmth and care.
Something I feel that has be missing from the past couple of years ads.

So with hindsight, I like it. Its nice. It's familiar, but it's still nice.

Plus - they launched this a week earlier than usual (they usually go online launch Thursday after Fireworks night, TV Friday night).

# Lego
<center>

https://youtube.com/watch?v=Yxmvp6LyseM
</center>

This is amazing. Seriously - its nuts but it makes me what to buy Lego.

Fantastic job

# Lidl
<center>

https://youtube.com/watch?v=SfexHlJ-BVU
</center>

I don't like this.
Like seriously don't like this.

They are doing the same ad in 3 different timeframes - and I just don't like Sci-Fi or the like.

# M&S (Clothing & Home)
<center>

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_85F9sX134
</center>

This is whimsical, whacky and just downright wonderful.
Will it make me buy things from M&S?
Maybe not, but it puts a smile on my face - and the retro song just brings back memories of previous Christmases in a good way.

They did not phone it in.
Good job.

(One thing though - does every single M&S Christmas need to feature Womans Lingerie? Seriously, look it up.)

# M&S (Food)
<center>

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dlem-MOMZOs
</center>

Usually the M&S Christmas ad is "Look, this is food porn. You want - well we sell it. Buy it" and you get an idea what may appear on the table at every party / Christmas table that year.

This is something else.
Seriously.
At this point I'm now expecting Brian Blessed to appear and shout "Percy is ALIVE" after seeing this.

Also - getting Dawn French as the Fairy on the tree: Genius. You know its her straight away, and its just all works.

No wonder M&S are extremely possessive of [Colin the Caterpillar...](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-56756731)

Very impressed

# Not on the High Street

https://youtube.com/watch?v=kHEOUe75gtM
</center>

I really like the music (Instrumental 'Hark the herald angel sing' I think) but I do find it boring.
Like sure - I may browse their site, but too much choice is worse than too little...

# NOW That's What I Call Christmas
<center>

https://youtube.com/watch?v=usCqcy_KHcQ
</center>

They are still producing these? And in the word of streaming, are these still relevant these days?

# Pandora
<center>

https://youtube.com/watch?v=CXHpkLLzzZs
</center>

If you need to give a gift to a female (any female) and unsure what to buy - then Pandora has you covered.

# Selfridges
<center>

https://youtube.com/watch?v=2W_y7PusU2Y
</center>

Its cheezy, it tacky, and its exactly what I expect - the things you don't expect.
I do expect Selfridges to be a little off the wall, surreal at points.
Reminds me of Christmas from the 50s thru 70s, tinsel everywhere.
Were they not the department store that suggested the "Upside down Christmas tree" as a thing?

# Smyths Toy Superstores
<center>

https://youtube.com/watch?v=SnFikInf3fo
</center>

"Kids, remind your parents that Smyths sell toys."

You could put that ad on in July and I think would still make sense.

# Sports Direct
<center>

https://youtube.com/watch?v=MPaZ8EgO4C0
</center>

What on earth?
The company that has become a byword for "Illegal employment practises" produced this?
And it has Emma Raducanu feature in it (in addition to others)

This makes no sense.

# Three
<center>

https://youtube.com/watch?v=-571r0qmLus
</center>

I was not expecting the dogs.
Yet again, I always feel getting a phone contract for Christmas is not the best idea.
It was fine, but not great.

# TK Maxx
<center>

https://youtube.com/watch?v=16M0btSMrt8
</center>

One time on this - if Christmas recitals turned into someone playing funk on an organ, I may actually go to one on my own regard.

TK Maxx has been off the wall in previous years ([Last year it was a Goat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgIigoL1Lro)), but this is something else.

Memorable - yes. Related to Christmas really? - Nope

# Very
<center>

https://youtube.com/watch?v=_yrQ38RBh1c
</center>

Very went really early with a teaser during Bake Off in early October, but this appears to be the full thing.
I like this. Not over the top like this - but they have managed to cover most things that seem to happen at Christmas.
Well done.

# Vistaprint
<center>

https://youtube.com/watch?v=4q0zTPPNi9o
</center>

Very clever. Impressed how clever is it.

# Vodafone
<center>

https://youtube.com/watch?v=pJUIlPftPIU
</center>

This is really clever and slick.
Considering there is going to be alot of phones replaced at Christmas, I can really see this taking off (and its a noble thing Vodafone are doing).
Ideally I hope this appears post Christmas also.

Its not over the top, it's subtle and it works.
