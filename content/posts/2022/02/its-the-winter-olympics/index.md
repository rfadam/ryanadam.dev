Its Winter Olympics time!

Yes, only 180 since the last Olympics, is time again for the best in *Winter* International sport to take over the overnight slot on BBC One.

So here is my initial thoughts going in for events:

- Curling is a must watch as its calm, controlled and Team GB have a hope in hell of doing well in it. I fully expect I will be shouting "SWEEP" at the TV by the time of the Gold Medal match
  
- Ski Cross / most Freestyle Skiing events: This is just pure insanity, and like the [new sports at Tokyo 2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Summer_Olympics#New_sports) it is fantastic to watch. Snowboarding by extension also
  
- Bobsleigh (Jamaica is back), Skeleton & Luge also as they are again on the cusp of "Please don't try this at home"
  
- Ice Hockey is a tossup this year as the NFL players are staying home due to they leagues own COVID related issues and delays. Canada / USA may still do though.
  
- I'm not a fan of Figure Skating, so I may take a swerve on that.
  
- Yet I'm fully expecting to be surprised at some things and other sports not mentioned here. The new single / mixed events look interesting.
  

And if I had a support a country?

1. Great Britain / Team GB as well, I live here. If they are out / not participating/ etc:
  
2. Jamaica (if in the Bobsleigh). Two words: [Cool Runnings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_Runnings)
  
   1. (I know its a film, its fictional - but come on!)
    
3. Australia - as the only place they get snow is the [Snowy Mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowy_Mountains). They are underdogs here so you have to love them (although [very lucky in the past](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Bradbury#2002_Winter_Olympics)).
  
4. Then onto Countries that have a chance to do well: Canada, the Nordics, etc. Give me a reach to seem interested in why X should this (e.g. New World Record) and I can be convinced.
  

I'm not as invested into the Winter Olympics than the Summer Olympics - but lets see if that statement holds up when the flame gets extinguished later this month.
