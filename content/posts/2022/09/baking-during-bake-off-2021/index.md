So last year I (for some reason) decided to try and bake something every single week for 9 weeks straight while Bake Off (The Great British Baking show for folks in North America) was on.

Although I learned things last year, it appears I didn't learn my lesson and I attempted it again for 2021:

## Week 1 - Vanilla, Chocolate & Orange Marble Cake

## Week 2 - Chocolate Chip Shortbread

## Week 3 - Demi Baguettes

## Week 4 - Lemon cake with a Lemon caramel topping.

## Week 5 - Jam donuts

## Week 6 - Cream Puffs 

## Week 7 - Millionaires Shortbread

## Week 8 - Brownies

Anyone looking at this may think 'What happened to Week 9?'. Well, between work and preparing to travel for the first time in 2 years, I simply did not have time.
