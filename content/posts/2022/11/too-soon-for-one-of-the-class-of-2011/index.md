  sense? This is my attempt at it

So - I'm writing this as a way to try and understand the below. It may not make sense as a whole, but some parts may alone.

When I left High School, I was part of the class of 2011. A year that started off with 330 11 year olds enrolling into S1 in 2005, with a subset sticking it out for 6 years to go off to do new things and walk our own paths - not just the guide-railed path given to us by the Scottish Education System.

When you are part of a group, or cohort, or mass of people then there is somewhat benchmarking between everyone. I don't think its intensional, but its there. So many of us went to Uni, a large factor actually graduated, even less ended up being in a career that is linked to that degree. Then you get into "adulting": people buying a house, moving abroad for a new job, Marriage then kids. Its all part of growing up. Although I have lost touch with people, you do see the slight tidbit of info of people growing up: not just staying still as the slightly care free S6's about to go headfirst into the world that I remember people as.

Tonight though, as I write this (November 21st 2022) I believe I have just heard of the first death of a member of the Class of 2011.

I was in the same form class as Kirsty Miller since S1. We didn't go to the same Primary School, and to be honest we did not really belong to *exactly* the same friend group, but we knew each other and we respected each other (I felt). She was friendly, could take a joke and I don't remember her ever being nasty (even in the expected teenager way).

I remember that she always wanted to be a vet - as in that is the thing that stands out in my head: Kirsty Miller == Vet. When she got into Vet School, I was happy for her - as honestly she was doing something I got the impression she wanted to do and loved:

As I write this, the reports are hazy at best - and the fact I have lost touch with a-lot of people from my High School year (including Kirsty), this hits in a weird way. This is someone I expected to do great things, have no reason to think they could do great things, but is no longer here. I was not close to her (case the point of not seeing alot of these people in 11 years) but this still hits home weirdly. Someone my age, someone who I remember being kind and clever and trying bloody hard at things is no longer here.

My school has never had a 10 year school reunion for my year (perhaps it was covid, we may never know), but Kirsty would of been someone I would of went up to and had a genuine interest in how she got on since leaving High School.

I will never have that chance now, and that's scary. A life gone.

I can only give my condolences to Kirsty's family, friends, colleagues and pets at this time.

I cannot even start to understand what they will be feeling and thinking right now, and I really do not wish to try.

One of my final thoughts I have will be of the handprint board we did in the final days of High School. Kirsty's is in the bottom centre: it is only one that is 3 colours:
