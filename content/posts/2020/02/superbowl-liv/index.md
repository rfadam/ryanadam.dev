This marks the 8th year or so that I'm attempted to keep with the NFL, so of course I tried to watch the Superbowl live. On a Sunday night, the day before work.

Although there are parts of the game that go over my head, the ads don't. So in the style of Cabel Sassers (of Panic) annual firework look - here are the ads that caught my eye.

# First Quarter

## Porsche

This is the only I remember from the First Quarter being entertaining to me. Now I want to own a Taycan (and that the first time I've said that about a Porsche)

## Avocados from Mexico

I am now convinced its not a Superbowl or other major US sporting event unless there is an 'Avocados from Mexico' ad.

## Tide

I'm only listing this as this drove me crazy - although very clever to have it pop up in different ads, across different quarters for different products.

# Second Quarter

## Hyundai

You put Rachel Dratch with her [Boston accent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boston_Teens) in an ad and have Big Papi appear also I'm sold.

## No Time To Die (New James Bond film trailer)

Looks good, looking forward to it

# Third Quarter

## TurboTax

I feel that America is the only country that can have an ad about tax returns.

## Weathertech

Fluffy dog? Check

Touching story? Check

I'm struggling to see a reason why I should not like this.

# Forth Quarter

## Jeep

The fact that Jeep did this amazes me. I've re-watched this and the extended version again and this maybe my favourite ad this year.

## Audi

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvEAklsAAts

So some may dislike the song (sorry parents), but I liked this. Made me smile

## Microsoft

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xPn4DXIj5w

Microsoft didn't blow it here. Didn't advertise anything they sell, but I was still impressed. I would of never knew about the story of San Francisco 49ers offensive assistant coach Katie Sowers - the first Woman coach to make the Superbowl without this ad. Well done Microsoft.

# In Conclusion

**Was it a good game?** I don't really know honestly, I still don't understand American Football that well (or at all)

**What about the halftime show?** There are people better qualified than me to answer that question, but I think it was good.

**Whats your thoughts on what this means for next season** I don't have a clue
