## Starting off

So my desktop PC is a custom built Mini-ITX based desktop built back in Summer 2015 - and I've not shown it that much love over the years. In-fact - Ive not shown it any love really since I got it (expect doing the Windows 10 upgrade from Windows 8).

This PC was built back in May 2015 when I had just finished University, when I went to my flat at time time (who was about to start working with Rockstar) "I want to play GTA V, I like this case - any advice?". The parts list was chosen and spec'd out on [Election Night](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_United_Kingdom_general_election) and was built about a week later.

Since then, the specs have been:

| Component    | Selection                                                           |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CPU          | Intel Core i5-4460 3.2 GHz Quad-Core Processor                      |
| Motherboard  | MSI Z87I AC Mini ITX LGA1150 Motherboard                            |
| Memory       | Kingston HyperX Fury Blue 8 GB (1 x 8 GB) DDR3-1600 Memory          |
| Storage      | Western Digital Caviar Blue 1 TB 3.5" 7200RPM Internal Hard Drive   |
| Storage      | Samsung 850 EVO-Series 250 GB 2.5" Solid State Drive                |
| Video Card   | XFX Radeon R9 270X 2 GB Double Dissipation Video Card               |
| Case         | Silverstone RVZ01B Mini ITX Desktop Case                            |
| Power Supply | Silverstone 500 W 80+ Gold Certified Fully Modular SFX Power Supply |
| Case Fan     | be quiet! Pure Wings 2 120 51.4 CFM 120 mm Fan                      |

Since then - this PC has sat under my TV and worked well. GTA V could get anywhere between 30-60fps at 1920x1080 and the graphics card also used Mini Displayport so i could use the same cables to plug a monitor into it when I needed to use it as a sit down PC (usually Video editing or using Citrix to work from home).

## Fast forward to 2020

In 2019 I stepped onto the property ladded and bought my first flat, so when the January sales came around I finally bought a new TV to replace the hand-me-down 42inch Panasonic Plasma that was approaching 10 years old. I ended up with a 4K ready LG LED TV, and its very nice.

Since 2015, I also started to play Forza Horizon 4 - a game that newer than GTA V and appears to want more resources. The end result of these two is Forza Horizon has almost become unplayable now. On low setting at 1080, I am getting Frames per Second down to the teens.

As I'm now using this PC everyday (thanks to Work from Home due the Coronavirus pandemic, me playing more games due to the Coronavirus pandemic and also running Folding@Home also due to the Coronavirus pandemic) - this is the kickstart to give me PC some love and rebuild it to last another 5 years.

My plan is:

- Replace the GPU first, as that appears to be the low hanging fruit and will give me an uplift in graphics performance.
- Replace the CPU, Motherboard and Memory (if required).
- Keep the other components the same (case, power supply, storage, fans, etc). (Although if I replace my laptop, I would move the SSD from that into the desktop as a replacement for the 128GB SSD)
